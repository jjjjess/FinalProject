Big O Notion:

Looking at the Big O analysis of each method "COLOR.setOnAction(event -> {"

we believe the constant time algorithm is at play here, as the input sizes never changes
and only one radio button can be selected at a time, making the Big O notion of each method to be:

O(1)

for a program total to be:

O(3)
